    <h1>Nothing<hr></h1> 
        <p> 
            This is a paragraph about nothing. You will keep reading with the hopes that at some point meaning will be established. <b>It will not.</b> You will keep reading this hot garbage I put in text because just like those annoying people that cause traffic, you are committed to watching a wreck in motion. Clap for yourself you made it to the end <i>your parents must be proud.</i>
